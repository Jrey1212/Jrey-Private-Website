   // of the page.  The number succeding "setInterval('FUNCTION()'," is the speed of the images alternating in milliseconds
   //Note: this was a homework assignment for displaying "ads" on a webpage, hence why images in this file are referred to as such.  The images are of a 3D character rig I made with a random character generator and imported into Blender.
